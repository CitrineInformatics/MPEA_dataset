Abstract = {{Multicomponent alloys with multiple principal elements including high
   entropy alloys (HEAs) and compositionally complex alloys (CCAs) are
   attracting rapidly growing attention. The endless possibilities to
   explore new alloys and the hope for better combinations of materials
   properties have stimulated a remarkable number of research works in the
   last years. Most of these works have been based on experimental
   approaches, but ab initio calculations have emerged as a powerful
   approach that complements experiment and serves as a predictive tool for
   the identification and characterization of promising alloys.
   The theoretical ab initio modeling of phase stabilities and mechanical
   properties of multi-principal element alloys by means of density
   functional theory (DFT) is reviewed. A general thermodynamic framework
   is laid down that provides a bridge between the quantities accessible
   with DFT and the targeted thermodynamic and mechanical properties. It is
   shown how chemical disorder and various finite-temperature excitations
   can be modeled with DFT. Different concepts to study crystal and alloy
   phase stabilities, the impact of lattice distortions (a core effect of
   HEAs), magnetic transitions, and chemical short-range order are
   discussed along with specific examples. Strategies to study elastic
   properties, stacking fault energies, and their dependence on, e.g.,
   temperature or alloy composition are illustrated. Finally, we provide an
   extensive compilation of multi-principal element alloys and various
   material properties studied with DFT so far (a set of over 500
   alloy-property combinations).}},

Abstract = {{Microstructure and mechanical properties of the Fe-Mn-Cr-Ni-Al system
   non-equiatomic high entropy alloys with a different Al content (x = 0-14
   at.\%) were studied in the present work. The Fe40Mn25Cr20Ni15 alloy was
   composed of the face-centered cubic (fcc) matrix phase with a small
   amount of coarse bodycentered cubic (bcc) particles. Addition of a small
   amount of Al (x = 2-6) resulted in an increase in the fraction of the
   bcc phase to 26\% and the formation of fine B2 precipitates within the
   bcc phase. At higher amounts of Al (x = 10 and x = 14) the
   microstructure consisted of coarse bcc matrix grains with the B2
   precipitates inside. The alloys tend to become stronger with an increase
   in the Al content from 0 to 10 at.\%; further increase in Al
   concentration did not influence strength considerably. The alloys
   exhibited pronounced softening with an increase in testing temperature
   from 25 to 400 degrees C-600 degrees C. Ductility of the alloys was high

   with the single-phase FeCoNiCr parent alloy, the

   significant increase in yield strength and ultimate tensile strength but
   with little sacrifice in ductility. Similar to the single-phase FeCoNiCr

   precipitation-strengthened FeCoNiCrTi0.2 high-entropy alloy shows strong
   temperature dependence. When the temperature decreases from 293 K to 77
   K, its yield strength and ultimate tensile strength are increased from
   700 MPa to 860 MPa and from 1.24 GPa to 1.58 GPa, respectively,

Abstract = {{The improvement in strength is usually accompanied by ductility loss in
   structural materials, which is a long-standing conflict referred as the
   strength-ductility trade-off. Here we present a
   heterogeneous-structures-architecting strategy, in which we design bulk
   high-entropy alloys with the largely enhanced strength-ductility
   trade-off, possessing a yield strength of 711 MPa, a tensile strength of
   928 MPa, and a uniform elongation of 30.3\%. Such an enhancement of the
   strength-ductility trade-off is due to the microstructure comprised with
   a combination of the non-recrystallized and recrystallized grains
   arranged in complex heterogeneous structures with a characteristic
   dimension spanning from the submicron scale to the coarse-sized scale.
   The heterogeneous structures in the high-entropy alloy are produced by
   cold-rolling, followed by intermediate-temperature-annealing. Our
   results demonstrate that heterogeneous designs can be accomplished
   effectively by simple thermal treatments, which offer a design strategy
   towards a new generation of high-strength and high-ductility

Abstract = {{High-entropy alloys (HEAs), also known as multi-principal element alloys
   or multi-component alloys, have been the subject of numerous
   investigations since they were first described in 2004. The earliest HEA
   was the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi ``Cantor{''} alloy, but HEM now encompass
   a broad class of metallic and ceramic systems. The concept of utilizing
   the high entropy of mixing to develop stable multi-element alloys may
   not be scientifically correct but has produced extraordinary mechanical
   properties in specific HEAs, mainly CrCoNi-based alloys, associated with
   their continuous work-hardening rate that is sustained to large plastic
   strains (similar to 0.5) and at low temperatures. This, in combination
   with the high frictional forces on dislocations and a propensity for
   twinning, leads to outstandingly high fracture toughness values
   (exceeding 200 MPa.m(1/2)) and resistance to shear-band formation under
   dynamic loading. The critical shear strain for the onset of adiabatic
   shear band formation is similar to 7 for the Cantor alloy, much higher
   than that for conventional alloys, suggesting superior ballistic
   properties. The slower diffusion rates resulting from the multi-element
   environment contribute to the excellent intermediate temperature
   performance. We review the principal mechanical properties of these
   alloys with emphasis on the face-centered cubic systems, such as the
   CrCoNi-based alloys. Their favorable mechanical properties and ease of
   processing by conventional means suggest extensive utilization in many

Abstract = {{Seldom could metals and alloys maintain excellent properties in

   Moreover, the FCC-HCP (hexagonal close-packed) transition and serration
   lead to the sudden decline of ductility below 77 K. The dynamical
   modeling and analysis of serrations at 4.2 and 20 K verify the unstable

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The microstructure of the AlxCoCrFeNiTiy high entropy alloy (HEA) system
   was studied using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron
   microscopy. A microstructural evolution from single-phase FCC to FCC +
   BCC + B2 occurred with increasing Al content. The addition of a
   comparatively small amount of Ti led to the formation of a Fe-Cr sigma
   phase. The corrosion characteristics of the alloy system were studied
   across different compositions, with such an alloy system exhibiting a
   high resistance to general corrosion, superior to stainless steel 304L
   in 0.6 M NaCl. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarisation suggested that the
   HEAs studied underwent pitting corrosion following breakdown. From
   exposure testing, it was seen that very fine pitting, although not
   extensive in nature, was the principle form of corrosion for
   AlxCoCrFeNiTiy after prolonged immersion. There was little evidence of
   microgalvanic corrosion or selective dissolution of a particular phase
   observed, despite the heterogeneous microstructure and significant
   elemental segregation in the alloys studied. The composition of the
   surface films formed upon the Al(x)CoCrFeNiTi(y )alloys were elaborated
   by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which provided new and further
   insights regarding the surface films of such alloys. The study herein
   contributes to an emerging understanding of the corrosion

Abstract = {{In order to strengthen the face-centered-cubic (FCC) type CoCrFeMnNi

   enriched in sigma phase, which indicates that Mo element is beneficial

   of the alloys increases gradually from 216 to 765 MPa, while the
   fracture strain decreases from 50\% (no fracture) to 19\% with
   increasing of Mo. The alloy exhibits the best compressive performance
   when Mo content reaches 11\%, the yield strength, fracture strength and
   fracture strain are 547 MPa, 2672 MPa and 44\% respectively. The

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{High-entropy alloys (HEM), i.e., single-phase, (nearly) equiatomic
   multicomponent, metallic materials, are associated with novel mechanical
   properties, such as high strength, fracture resistance etc. In this
   paper, a stochastic Peierls-Nabarro (PN) model is proposed to understand
   how random site occupancy affects intrinsic strength. The stochastic PN
   model accounts for the randomness in the composition, characterized by
   both the standard deviation of the perturbation in the interplanar
   potential and the correlation length within the spatial compositional
   distribution. The model presented includes the effects of non-uniform
   compositional distribution both in the direction of dislocation glide
   and along a dislocation line to predict overall dislocation glide
   resistance. The model predicts the intrinsic strength of HEAs as a
   function of the standard deviation and the correlation length of the
   randomness. We find that, in most of the parameter space, the
   compositional randomness in an HEA gives rise to an intrinsic strength
   that far exceeds that of any of the pure metals from which the HEA is
   composed. This approach provides a fundamental explanation to the origin
   of the high strength of HEAs. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Single-phase multi-principal-element alloys (MPEAs) with face-centered
   cubic (FCC) structure generally exhibit low yield strength but superb
   ductility and strain hardening capability. In this work, we demonstrate
   that enhancing yield strength while retaining good ductility of single
   phase FCC MPEAs can be achieved by developing hierarchical
   microstructures. A non-equiatomic Cr20Fe6Co34Ni34Mo6 alloy with
   single-phase FCC structure was fabricated and immediately cold rolled
   with similar to 70\% thickness reduction after a liquid nitrogen bath.
   The cold-rolled sample was then annealed at various temperatures in a
   range of 675-1150 degrees C for various periods. As annealing
   temperature exceeds 800 degrees C, annealed samples exhibit
   coarse-grained microstructure and low yield strength, while high strain
   hardening rate and good ductility. As annealing temperature is lower
   than 800 degrees C, annealed samples develop hierarchical
   microstructures that comprise high density of annealing nano-twins in
   recrystallized fine grains (grain size similar to 1 mu m) and stable
   dislocation walls in non-fully recrystallized fine grains. The addition
   of Mo in the system is found to be very effective in retarding the
   recrystallization and grain growth, promoting formation of
   recrystallized fine grains. Mechanical tensile testing reveals that such
   kind of hierarchical microstructure enhances yield strength of single
   phase FCC MPEAs (1.1 GPa) while retains good ductility (uniform
   elongation of similar to 29\%) and high ultimate tensile strength (1.3
   GPa). Grain boundaries, twin boundaries and dislocation walls act as
   strong barriers for dislocation motion, enhancing yield strength and
   strain hardening capacity. Dislocation walls also act as sources for
   dislocations and deformation twins at large deformation stages,
   retaining a good ductility. Engineering such hierarchical
   microstructures should thus be an efficient strategy in enhancing
   mechanical properties of FCC MPEAs with low or medium stacking fault
   energies.}},

Abstract = {{Severe lattice distortion is a core effect in the design of
   multiprincipal element alloys with the aim to enhance yield strength, a
   key indicator in structural engineering. Yet, the yield strength values
   of medium- and high-entropy alloys investigated so far do not
   substantially exceed those of conventional alloys owing to the
   insufficient utilization of lattice distortion. Here it is shown that a
   simple VCoNi equiatomic medium-entropy alloy exhibits a near 1 GPa yield
   strength and good ductility, outperforming conventional solid-solution
   alloys. It is demonstrated that a wide fluctuation of the atomic bond
   distances in such alloys, i.e., severe lattice distortion, improves both
   yield stress and its sensitivity to grain size. In addition, the
   dislocation-mediated plasticity effectively enhances the
   strength-ductility relationship by generating nanosized dislocation
   substructures due to massive pinning. The results demonstrate that
   severe lattice distortion is a key property for identifying extra-strong
   materials for structural engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{Twinning is a key deformation mechanism in face-centered-cubic
   (fcc)-based and some body-centered cubic (bcc)-based alloys, which
   imparts excellent strength-ductility combination by increasing
   strain-hardenability. Typically, twinning in fcc-based alloys increases
   when the stacking fault energy is lowered via changes in composition.
   The present study clearly demonstrates that deformation twinning can be
   enhanced when hard-intermetallic compounds like ordered B2 and sigma
   phases form in the fcc matrix of a high entropy alloy (HEA), leading to
   an excellent combination of strength, ductility, and
   strain-hardenability. Such a combination of properties was achieved by
   exploiting the novel and often unusual phase stability regimes that can
   be accessed in these complex concentrated HEAs. The present study
   exploits a unique three-phase mixture of recrystallized fine-grained fcc
   + B2 sigma in a prototypical Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA to demonstrate this
   effect. Coupling transmission electron microscopy and molecular dynamics
   simulations revealed that B2 grains enhance deformation twinning by
   raising the local stress levels, consequently forming substantially
   thicker twins as compared to the single fcc-phase condition of
   Al0.3CoCrFeNi. The local stresses were further accommodated via
   nano-twinning, limited B2 plasticity, and highly restricted micro-cracks
   in and around the sigma grains. (C) 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

   phase at 500-700 degrees C or a sigma phase particles at 600-800 degrees

   resulted in a continuous growth of both the fcc grans and bcc/sigma

   investigated the HCF and tensile deformation behavior of equiatomic
   CoCrFeMnNi HEA. In order to suggest the possibility of the material's
   application in an as-homogenized state, coarse-grained (CG) equiatomic
   CoCrFeMnNi HEA was prepared. Microstructural observation measured an
   average grain size of 245.5 mu m, and it was confirmed to have a
   face-centered cubic (FCC) random solid solution. A tensile test
   confirmed that the yield strength and tensile strength are 293.1 MPa and
   625.6 MPa, respectively, and change in the work hardening rate according

   observed. A high-cycle fatigue results shows fatigue strength of 280
   MPa, which is close to its yield strength, and this confirmed that the
   material has outstanding high-cycle fatigue properties considering its
   yield strength. DT is uniquely formed at cycle loading with a stress
   level lower than the critical twinning stress (sigma(T)), and this can
   improve yield strength by approximately 95\% and tensile strength by
   approximately 17\%. Based on the above findings, this study discussed
   the role of DTs which affect the high-cycle fatigue and deformation
   behavior of coarse-grained HEA.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of heat treatment on the microstructure and properties of
   cold-forged two-dimensional (2D) CoNiFe medium entropy alloy (MEA) are
   determined. Compared to the as-cast specimen with a columnar crystal
   structure, the cold-forged CoNiFe MEA has a heavily fragmented
   microstructure with deformation twins. As the annealing temperature is
   increased, the grain size becomes larger markedly. Annealing at 900
   degrees C yields a fully recrystallized microstructure with a large
   population of annealing twins and the new orientation exhibits a first
   order twin relationship (60 degrees < 111 > rotation) during
   recrystallization. Moreover, the CoNiFe HEA annealed at 900 degrees C
   possesses excellent ductility (epsilon = 50\%) and work-hardening
   ability (sigma(UTS)-sigma(Y) = 246 MPa, sigma(UTS)-sigma(Y) = 0.5),
   which depend on the annealing twins, dislocations, as well as
   micro-shear bands in the grains. Analysis of the fracture surface
   indicates that the main failure mechanism is ductile. Meanwhile, no
   phase separation occurs as the temperature is raised from 0 degrees C to
   1000 degrees C as shown by the expansion rate versus temperature
   relationship, indicating that the materials have good stability at high
   temperature. The thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the sample
   annealed at 1100 degrees C for 1 h is 12.1 x 10(-6) K-1 which is less
   than that of traditional metals (14.4-16 x 10(-6) K-1).}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates the effectiveness of a cryogenic torsional
   pre-straining for significantly improving the cryogenic strength of an
   equiatomic CrCoNi alloy. The origin of this phenomenon is elucidated by
   various microstructural characterization tools, which shows that the
   sequential torsion and tension tests lead to the observed hierarchical
   microstructure through the activation of different twinning systems and
   stacking faults. This gives rise to the significant increase in the
   yield strength from 600 MPa to 1215 MPa, while the fracture strain
   changes from 68\% to 48\%. The current study reveals that the
   incorporation of nanotwins architecture by shear deformation may
   constitute a viable strategy to tune the mechanical performance and, in
   particular, to dramatically increase the strength while keeping a good

Abstract = {{In this study, we report the effect of elemental combinations on the
   friction stress and Hall-Petch relationship in medium entropy alloys
   (MEAs) and high entropy alloys (HEAs) which are defined as the alloys
   composed of four or less and five or more principal elements,
   respectively, with (near-) equiatomic concentrations. The MEAs
   (CoCrFeNi, CoCrNi, etc.), which are subsystems of equi-atomic
   CoCr-FeMnNi HEA, were highly deformed by high-pressure torsion (HPT) and
   subsequently annealed at different temperatures. The specimens with
   fully-recrystallized microstructures of FCC single-phase with various
   mean grain sizes down to sub-micrometer scale were obtained.
   Subsequently, tensile tests were performed at room temperature to obtain
   precise Hall-Petch relationships and friction stresses of the materials.
   Co-20(CrNi)(80) was successfully predicted as the alloy showing the
   highest strength among the MEAs by the modified Labusch model (so-called
   mean field Labusch model) for solution hardening. Experimental values of
   the friction stresses were found to fit with the model very well,
   indicating that the strength of the alloys was closely related to
   entirely distorted crystal lattice acting as high-density obstacles for
   dislocation motion in the alloys. At the same time, values of the
   average lattice distortion in the alloys were found comparable to those
   in some dilute alloys, although ``severe{''}{''} lattice distortion had
   been believed as a reason for the higher strength than dilute systems.
   Finally, a strengthening mechanism by element-element interaction was
   proposed as an additional mechanism to enhance the strength in FCC HEAs
   and MEAs. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted a great deal of interest over
   the last 14 years. One reason for this level of interest is related to
   these alloys breaking the alloying principles that have been applied for
   many centuries. Thus, HEAs usually possess a single phase (contrary to
   expectations according to the composition of the alloy) and exhibit a
   high level of performance in different properties related to many
   developing areas in industry. Despite this significant interest, most
   HEAs have been developed via ingot metallurgy. More recently, powder
   metallurgy (PM) has appeared as an interesting alternative for further
   developing this family of alloys to possibly widen the field of
   nanostructures in HEAs and improve some capabilities of these alloys. In
   this paper, PM methods applied to HEAs are reviewed, and some possible
   ways to develop the use of powders as raw materials are introduced.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of local lattice distortion (LLD) is of fundamental
   importance in the understanding of properties of high-entropy alloys
   and, more generally, of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs). Despite
   previous experimental and computational efforts, the unambiguous
   evaluation of the static (due to atomic size difference) and dynamic
   (due to thermal fluctuation) LLD is still elusive. Here, as a first
   step, we develop a machine learning interatomic potential based on an
   efficient ``learning-on-the-fly{''} scheme for CoFeNi, a prototypical
   ternary MPEA. Using this potential, we perform molecular dynamics
   simulations to calculate the elastic moduli of single- and
   polycrystalline CoFeNi. The results are in excellent agreement with
   theoretical and experimental data. As a second step, we design a
   simulation framework allowing the determination of the effects of static
   and dynamic LLD, thermal expansion, and chemical short-range order on
   the elastic properties of our prototypical MPEA. The results indicate
   that not only the average value of LLD, but also its probability
   distribution affect the elastic properties of MPEAs. In addition, we
   show that a variety of commonly used LLD indicators, e.g., atomic
   strain, pair distribution function, and bond-length distribution,
   correlate with each other. Our results not only shed light on the of LLD
   in MPEAs, but also demonstrate the capabilities of our machine learning
   potential as a powerful tool for the development and characterization of
   novel alloys with designed properties. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, gas-atomized AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) powders
   were prepared by gas atomization process instead of ball milling method
   and the variations of annealing temperature on the crystal structure,

   investigated. This equatomic HEAs powder possesses an initial phase of
   BCC while the FCC and minor sigma phases could be adjusted via the
   annealing treatment. After the annealing process at 900 degrees C over 3
   h, the phase constitution of gas-atomized AlCoCrFeNi gradually reached
   its stable state, composed of FCC + BCC phases. The BCC phase was
   identified as one kind of FeCo compound and served as the base of
   AlCoCrFeNi HEAs. During the annealing process, Cr element was separated
   and (Al, Ni)-rich phases were distributed in the uniform FeCo base.
   Based on such a microstructure, we found that the precipitated FCC and

Abstract = {{In this study, the microstructures, microhardness, compression

   denoted as W-free, W-0.2, and W-0.5, respectively) high-entropy alloys

   the severe lattice distortion, and thus aggravates the driving force of
   composition decomposition for W-free HEA. The dual-phase with
   face-centered cubic (FCC) microstructure in W-0.2 and W-0.5 HEAs was
   identified. In addition, a mu-(FeCoCr)(7)W-6 phase precipitate from the
   matrix in W-0.5 HEA. Moreover, the 11.12 at.\% W addition induces the
   formation of cell dendrites and eutectic inter-dendrites with fine
   laminar spacing in W-0.5 HEA. W addition obviously decreases the grain
   size, and enhances the microhardness and yield strength of W-free HEA.
   The W-0.5 HEA has the high microhardness of 357.9 HV and yield strength
   of 556 MPa, while maintaining the reasonable fracture strain of 35.6\%.
   The strengthening mechanism of mechanical properties can be attributed
   to the grain refinement strengthening, solid-solution strengthening, and
   interface hardening. The enhancements of the latter two strengthening
   effects depend upon the existence of dual FCC phases. The pitting
   resistance of the containing-W HEAs is enhanced in seawater solution
   compared with W-free HEA. Especially, the W-0.5 HEA bears the best
   pitting resistance and easy passivation behavior, owing to that W
   addition improves the stability of the protective layer.}},

   work, three novel MoNbFeCrV, MoNbFeCrTi, and MoNbFeVTi HEAs containing
   low thermal neutron absorption cross section elements were prepared by
   vacuum arc melting. The microstructure, mechanical properties, and
   corrosion behaviors were investigated. A dominant body-centered cubic
   (BCC) phase was present in all these three HEAs. In addition, an ordered
   Laves phase was found to be another major phase in both MoNbFeCrV and

   MoNbFeVTi alloy. The phase formation in these three alloys was
   discussed. It is found that the formation of the secondary phase in
   these alloys is mainly ascribed to the large atomic size difference and
   electronegativity difference. All the three HEAs show high hardness,
   high yield strength but limited plasticity. Moreover, the MoNbFeCrV,
   MoNbFeCrTi and MoNbFeVTi alloys exhibit excellent corrosion resistance

   content of 0.073 at.\% was enough to promote the formation of M23C6
   phase, which had a preference to precipitate at the grain boundary. With
   the contribution of M23C6 carbides, the yield strength and ultimate
   tensile strength of the sample aged at 900 degrees C increased by 193
   MPa and 415 MPa, respectively, compared to the solid solutionized
   sample, while its elongation remained as high as 88\%. Nanoscale
   L1(2)-ordered precipitates occurred in the alloy after aging at 700 and
   550 degrees C. Cu-rich phase was only found in the alloy aged at 700
   degrees C, and its precipitation kinetics is slower than that of the
   L1(2) phase. The synergetic strengthening of the coherent M23C6 carbides
   at grain boundaries and L1(2) and Cu-rich particles in the matrix of the
   alloys aged at 700 degrees C rendered the highest strength (904 MPa)
   while sustaining a high elongation of 39\% at room temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The development of high-pressure torsion (HPT) processing has increased
   the possibility for achieving significant grain refinement, which leads
   to a material's ability to produce ultrafine-grained or nanocrystalline
   materials having enhanced strength without a large expense of ductility
   at room temperature. Since the applied strain is locally changed across
   the sample disc during HPT, the microstructure and thus mechanical
   properties vary within the disc. Recently, as a promising tool for
   characterizing the mechanical behavior of the local regions within the
   disc, the nanoindentation technique becomes widely used mainly due to
   its simple and easy testing procedures and the requirement of only small
   volume of material. The nanoindentation technique provides important
   clues to better understand the relation between microstructural
   refinement and mechanical property enhancement of the HPT-processed
   materials. Here, the nanoindentation studies performed on various
   HPT-processed materials are reviewed with focus on a variety of

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the effects of substitution of Co with Ni
   on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and age hardening of three
   Co1-xCoFeNi1+xTi0.3 high-entropy alloys (x values describe molar ratios;
   where x = 0, 0.5, 1, denoted as X-0, X-0.5, and X-1, respectively). All
   alloys after hot rolling at 1200 degrees C showed a simple face-centered
   cubic phase with an average grain size of 90 mu m. As the value of x
   increased, the hardness, yield stress, and ultimate tensile strength of
   the alloys also increased from HV263, 540 MPa, and 772 MPa to HV335, 672
   MPa, and 982 MPa, respectively. However, the elongation decreased from
   60\% to 37\% because of the more negative mixing enthalpy (Delta H-mix)
   of Ni with other constitutional elements, resulting in a simultaneous
   increase in the strength and brittleness of the grains. The aged alloys
   X-0 and X-0.5 to X-1 showed optimal age hardening at 700 degrees C and
   600 degrees C, respectively, which were associated with the
   precipitation of profuse sigma + eta phases. For the three alloys, the
   sigma and eta phases completely dissolved into the matrix at 1000
   degrees C and 1100 degrees C, respectively. After age treatment of the
   alloys at 1200 degrees C, the average grain diameter of the X-0 to X-1
   alloys increased from 216 mu m to 324 mu m, indicating that alloys with
   larger mixing entropy suppressed grain growth at high temperatures
   because of the sluggish diffusion effect. Application of the Hall-Petch
   equation (H = H-0 + k(H) d(-1/2)) revealed that with increases in x
   value, H-0 and k(H) increased from HV36 and 2236 to HV62 and 2586,
   respectively. The more negative Delta H-mix of Ni with other

Abstract = {{Compression stress-strain curves of a number of refractory high entropy

Abstract = {{Alloying has long been used to confer desirable properties to materials.
   Typically, it involves the addition of relatively small amounts of
   secondary elements to a primary element. For the past decade and a half,
   however, a new alloying strategy that involves the combination of
   multiple principal elements in high concentrations to create new
   materials called high-entropy alloys has been in vogue. The
   multi-dimensional compositional space that can be tackled with this
   approach is practically limitless, and only tiny regions have been
   investigated so far. Nevertheless, a few high-entropy alloys have
   already been shown to possess exceptional properties, exceeding those of
   conventional alloys, and other outstanding high-entropy alloys are
   likely to be discovered in the future. Here, we review recent progress
   in understanding the salient features of high-entropy alloys. Model
   alloys whose behaviour has been carefully investigated are highlighted
   and their fundamental properties and underlying elementary mechanisms
   discussed. We also address the vast compositional space that remains to
   be explored and outline fruitful ways to identify regions within this

Abstract = {{AlCoCrFeNi is among one of the most-widely studied alloy systems in the
   high entropy alloy (HEA) area. It exhibits interesting microstructure
   and unique mechanical properties. In this study, we assessed the
   feasibility of producing the AlCoCrFeNi alloy using powder metallurgy
   technique in which the pre-alloy powders were obtained through gas
   atomization and sintering was achieved by spark plasma sintering (SPS).
   Extensive microstructure and mechanical property characterizations were
   conducted to assist our understanding of the effects of processing
   conditions (i.e., sintering temperature) on the microstructure and
   mechanical properties of obtained materials. Current results indicate
   that powder metallurgy (in this study, gas atomization + SPS) could be
   used as an alternative for HEA fabrication. The pre-alloy powders
   exhibit microstructure (BCC + B2) similar to reported as-cast
   microstructure. Sintered parts with good combination of strength and
   compression limit (similar to 2368 MPa, 22.1\%) can be achieved by an
   appropriate selection of sintering temperature (for example, 1100
   degrees C). Similar to previous observations, temperature exerts an
   important role on microstructural evolution. Fully consolidated part
   cannot be obtained when the sintering temperature was lower than 900
   degrees C. Sintering at 1100 degrees C the higher yielded parts with
   near-fully density can be obtained. With the increasing of sintering
   temperature, FCC phase depletion with Al and Ni tends to form. The
   network BCC phase within the B2 phase grows and gathers to the boundary
   of the B2 phase with the sintering temperature above 1200 degrees C.
   Further studies will be conducted to have a full picture of this
   microstructure behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the effects of cold drawing deformation
   on the microstructure and mechanical properties of CoCrFeMnNi high
   entropy alloy. The results showed that at low strain (<= 0.28), the
   plastic deformation is dominated by planar slip with the formation of
   slip bands, Lomer-Cottrell locks and Taylor lattices. While at medium to
   high strain (between 0.28 and 1.96), the microstructure consisted of
   dislocation cells, deformation twins (including the primary and
   secondary twins) and irregular dislocation (i.e. randomly distributed
   dislocation clusters). At high strains ( > 1.96), deformation is mainly
   mediated by twinning and shear banding causing the formation of lamellae
   structures parallel to metal flow direction. Texture evolution showed
   that the <111> fiber texture was the stable texture component and the
   <100> fiber texture became unstable at low strain. At strains higher
   than 1.96, the texture component content remained unchanged even under
   further increased strain, and the volume fractions of <111>, <100> and
   complex texture components were 57.4\%, 30.7\% and 11.9\%, respectively.
   Additionally, the microhardness and yield strength increased
   monotonically with increased strain. At the early stages of deformation,
   activation of planar slip causes the initial HEA to display a very high
   strain hardening rate. The hardness value saturated at 430 HV at the
   strain of 2.77, which is about 3 times larger than the initial hardness
   value. Pre-strain by cold drawing deformation can significantly enhance
   the yield strength of the CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy by twinning and
   texture strengthening. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   hot deformation behavior of the as-cast ingot was investigated to guide
   the hot forging process. Annealing was further conducted on the

   as-forged HEA had yield strength (YS) of 792 MPa, ultimate tensile
   strength of 1055 MPa and a satisfactory fracture elongation (EL) of

   MPa to 512 MPa and EL from 26.5\% to 55.3\% in comparison with the
   as-cast HEA. It is suggested that the enhanced yield strength of the as
   annealed HEA was attributed to carbon interstitial solid solution
   strengthening, grain refining and precipitation of tiny carbides, and
   the improvement of ductility was due to the elimination of cast defects
   and twinning-induced plasticity. This work paved the way for the

Abstract = {{The microstructures determine the macro-mechanical properties in metals

   high-entropy alloys (HEAs) rapidly cooled to room temperature still

   prepared by various cooling rates and the deformation behaviour using
   molecular dynamic simulation. The results show that the radial
   distribution function of HEM is in good agreement with the previous
   experimental result. The amorphous HEA is formed at high cooling rates,
   while the nanocrystalline HEA is generated at low cooling rates. The
   hybrid amorphous crystallization structured HEA occurs at middle cooling
   rates. For low cooling rates, the considerable amount of
   face-centered-cubic and hexagonal-close-packed short-range orders
   clearly show the crystal-nucleation process in the supercooled liquid of
   HEAs. The high residual hydrostatic stress around grain boundaries is
   observed in the nanocrystaline HEAs. Moreover, the nanocrystal HEA
   presents a high strength, compared to the amorphous HEA. The amorphous
   HEA exhibits the stable flow stress due to no obvious local stress
   concentration. This result could help guide the preparation of HEM with
   a high strength by controlling the cooling rate, which generates the

Abstract = {{The equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) exhibits outstanding
   toughness and excellent strength-ductility combination at cryogenic
   temperatures. However, its strength is relatively low at room
   temperature. In order to strengthen this HEA, microalloying additions of
   0.8 at.\% Nb and C were made and its properties and microstructure
   evaluated. It was found that the microalloying resulted in the formation
   of carbide precipitates and a reduction of the grain size to similar to
   2.6 mu m. As a result, the room-temperature tensile yield strength (732
   MPa) of the microalloyed HEA is roughly double that of the base HEA
   (with a concomitant increase in the ultimate strength) while its
   ductility is maintained at a relatively high level (elongation to
   fracture of similar to 32\%). The strengthening is due to precipitation
   hardening from the nanoscale carbide particles and grain refinement.

   Precipitation behavior and mechanical properties of the hot-worked

   TiNbTa0.5ZrAl0.5 alloy exhibits a high compressive yield strength of
   1740 MPa with a compressive stain of 20\%. It is interesting that
   annealing at lower or higher temperatures than 1000 degrees C causes a

Abstract = {{An ultrafine-structured FeCoCrNiMn high-entropy alloy (HEA) was produced
   by severe cold rolling (SCR) with a 95 pct reduction, and the effect of
   annealing temperature over a wide range from 573 K to 1373 K (300
   degrees C to 1100 degrees C) on the microstructure and mechanical
   properties of this SCRed HEA was systematically investigated. The
   results show that the microstructure of the single-phase FCC HEA after
   SCR is greatly refined and mainly comprises ultrafine crystalline,
   high-density dislocation cell and networks, which substantially improve
   the hardness and strength. The SCRed HEA starts to recrystallize at an
   annealing temperature of 773 K (500 degrees C) and is fully
   recrystallized at 973 K (700 degrees C) after 1 hours. The sigma phases
   with a tetragonal structure form upon annealing at 773 K (500 degrees
   C), leading to a further enhancement in hardness and strength for the
   annealed HEA compared to the SCRed HEA. The average grain size remains
   below 500 nm when the SCRed HEA is annealed at 923 K (650 degrees C) for
   1 hours, indicating that the ultrafine-structured HEA after SCR and
   subsequent annealing treatment possesses excellent microstructural
   thermal stability. The SCRed HEAs annealed at 923 K and 973 K (650
   degrees C and 700 degrees C) exhibit excellent high strength-ductility
   combinations due to the formation of the fully recrystallized
   ultrafine-grained microstructure. The strain-rate sensitivity parameter
   (m value) with different grain sizes, from ultrafine to coarse, was
   evaluated by strain-rate jump tests. The m value of the HEA increases
   monotonically with increasing grain size and annealing temperature.
   Moreover, high-temperature tensile tests demonstrated that the annealed
   HEAs exhibit superplastic deformation behavior at 973 K and 1073 K (700
   degrees C and 800 degrees C), and the formation of a Cr-rich phase is
   found during high-temperature deformation. It is believed that the
   plastic deformation facilitates the phase decomposition of fine-grained
   HEAs and grain boundary sliding is the key mechanism of high-temperature
   deformation.}},

   Al25Co25Cr25Fe25 (all in at\%) high entropy alloy consisted of a matrix
   with a high concentration of Al, Co and Fe, in which spherical grains
   (50-200 nm) enriched in Cr were embedded. Both the matrix and grains had
   body centered cubic structures. The addition of nickel to a four-element

   microstructure of the Al20Co20Cr20Fe20Ni20, Al10Co30Cr20Fe35Ni5 and
   Al15Co30Cr15Fe40Ni5 HEAs consisted of fine grains measuring 50-500 nm

   strength of 3500 MPa, and a low strain of 0.7\%, for the

   plastic FCC phases responsible for a decrease in strength with increases
   in ductility, which, in the new non-equiatomic Al10Co30Cr20Fe35Ni5 high

Abstract = {{A novel Cu-1.01\%Ni-0.28\%Si-0.14\%Co-0.45\%Cr (mass percent) alloy with
   high strength and high conductivity was fabricated. Microstructure,
   mechanical and electrical properties of the alloy after multi-stage
   thermo-mechanical treatment were investigated in detail. The alloy has
   excellent comprehensive properties, with a tensile strength of 810 MPa,
   yield strength of 777 MPa, elongation of 3.4\%, and electrical
   conductivity of 57.5\%IACS (International Annealing Copper Standard).
   Three kinds of precipitates, (Cr,Co)(2)Si, (Ni,Co)(2)Si and Cr, form
   during aging treatment. Addition of Co element promotes the
   precipitation of Cr, Ni and Si solute elements from the matrix, while
   inhibits the growth of the (Cr,Co)(2)Si. The high strength of the alloy
   treated by multi-stage thermo-mechanical process is attributed to the
   dispersion strengthening, sub-structure strengthening, and work
   hardening. The multi-aging process and addition of Co effectively
   improve the electrical conductivity of the studied alloy. The high
   strength and high conductivity of studied alloy make it as a potential
   candidate for lead frame materials in electrical and electronics
   industry.}},

Abstract = {{The field of multi-principal element or (single-phase) high-entropy (HE)
   alloys has recently seen exponential growth as these systems represent a
   paradigm shift in alloy development, in some cases exhibiting unexpected
   structures and superior mechanical properties. However, the

   given the associated vastness of the chemistry/composition space. We
   describe here a supervised learning strategy for the efficient screening
   of HE alloys that combines two complementary tools, namely: (1) a
   multiple regression analysis and its generalization, a
   canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) and (2) a genetic algorithm (GA)
   with a CCA-inspired fitness function. These tools permit the
   identification of promising multi-principal element alloys. We implement
   this procedure using a database for which mechanical property
   information exists and highlight new alloys having high hardnesses. Our
   methodology is validated by comparing predicted hardnesses with alloys
   fabricated by arc-melting, identifying alloys having very high measured
   hardnesses.}},

Abstract = {{Al0.8CoCrFeNiTi0.2 high entropy alloys were prepared by vacuum arc

   using XRD, OM, EPMA, hardness tester, universal testing machine, and

   morphology of the alloys. The as-cast alloy consists of bcc and fcc
   solid solutions, while the 600, 800 and 1000 degrees C annealed alloys
   consist of bcc, fcc and a phase. In the 800 degrees C annealed alloy,

   mixed structure and the better the composition uniformity. But the 1000
   degrees C-annealed alloy has a large block single-phase solid solution

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{High-entropy alloys (HEM) have been receiving intensive attention due to
   their unusual properties that largely depend on the selection among
   three phases: solid solution (SS), intermetallic compound (IM), and
   mixed SS and IM (SS + IM). Accurate phase prediction is therefore
   crucial for guiding the selection of a combination of elements to form a
   HEA with desirable properties. It is widely accepted that the phase
   selection is correlated with elemental features such as valence electron
   concentration and the formation enthalpy, leading to a set of parametric
   phase-selection rules {[}1]. Previous studies on predicting the phase
   selection employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
   obtain some correlated parameters. But DFT calculations are time
   consuming and exhibit uncertainties in terms of treating the d orbitals
   of transition-metal atoms that are often components of HEAs. Here we
   employ machine learning (ML) algorithms to efficiently explore phase
   selection rules using a comprehensive experimental dataset consisting of
   401 different HEAs including 174 SS, 54 IM, and 173 SS + IM phases. We
   adopt three different ML algorithms: K-nearest neighbours (KNN), support
   vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). To avoid
   overfitting, we divide the whole dataset into four nearly equal portions
   to perform a cross validation. For the classification of the three
   phases at the same time, the testing accuracy values from the KNN, SVM
   and ANN calculations achieve 68.6\%, 64.3\% and 743\%, respectively. We
   then focus on the classification of two of the three phases using SVM
   and ANN. We find that the testing accuracy values using ANN in
   classifying the SS and IM phases, the SS + IM and IM phases, and the SS
   and SS + IM phases, are 86.7\%, 94.3\%, and 78.9\%, respectively, which
   are higher than the corresponding testing accuracy values using SVM. As
   such, the trained ANN model performs the best among the three ML
   algorithms and is useful for predicting the phases of new HEAs. Our work
   provides an alternative route of computational design of HEAs, which is
   also applicable to accelerate the discovery of other metal alloys for
   modern engineering applications. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

Title = {{Effects of Annealing on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of
   Metastable Powder Metallurgy CoCrFeNiMo0.2 High Entropy Alloy}},

Abstract = {{A CoCrFeNiMo0.2 high entropy alloy (HEA) was prepared through powder
   metallurgy (P/M) process. The effects of annealing on microstructural
   evolution and mechanical properties of P/M HEAs were investigated. The
   results show that the P/M HEA exhibit a metastable FCC single-phase
   structure. Subsequently, annealing causes precipitation in the grains
   and at the grain boundaries simultaneously. As the temperature
   increases, the size of the precipitates grows, while the content of the
   precipitates tends to increase gradually first, and then decrease as the
   annealing temperature goes up to 1000 degrees C. As the annealing time
   is prolonged, the size and content of the precipitates gradually
   increases, eventually reaching a saturated stable value. The mechanical
   properties of the annealed alloys have a significant correspondence with
   the precipitation behavior. The larger the volume fraction and the size
   of the precipitates, the higher the strength and the lower the
   plasticity of the HEA. The CoCrFeNiMo0.2 high entropy alloy, which
   annealed at 800 degrees C for 72 h, exhibited the most excellent
   mechanical properties with the ultimate tensile strength of about 850
   MPa and an elongation of about 30\%. Nearly all of the annealed HEAs
   exhibit good strength-ductility combinations due to the significant
   precipitation enhancement and nanotwinning. The separation of the coarse
   precipitation phase and the matrix during the deformation process is the
   main reason for the formation of micropores. Formation of large volume
   fraction of micropores results in a decrease in the plasticity of the
   alloy.}},

Abstract = {{High entropy alloys (HEAs) with a single fcc phase are usually ductile
   but not strong, while HEAs with a single bcc phase have high strength

   adopted to optimize the mechanical properties. Based on a latest data
   collection of reported HEAs with a single fcc phase, with dual fcc and
   bcc phases, and with a single bcc phase, the current work shows that the
   average valence electron concentration (VEC) and its standard deviation
   (VEC) can describe quantitatively phase selection between the fcc and
   bcc phases in HEAs. Highest (lowest) hardness, highest (lowest)
   strength, and lowest (highest) ductility were found at the same critical
   value of VEC{*} approximate to 6.13 (VEC{*} approximate to 0.207), which
   corresponds to the HEA with a single bcc (fcc) phase. The current work

   forming the seaweed eutectic dendrites. The hardness of the FCC phase
   was found to be highly related to the solute strengthening effect, the
   formation of nanotwins and the transition from CoCrFeNiPd-rich to
   CoCrFeNi-rich FCC phase. Hierarchical nanotwins were found in the

Abstract = {{High and Medium-Entropy Alloys (HEM and MEAs) are a novel type of
   materials, which due to the reduction in configurational entropy, can
   offer an excellent combination of properties, such as, high strength,
   high ductility and moderate hardness. During the study, four alloys
   based on Fe50-XMn30Co10Cr10BX system (x = 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.7 wt\%) were
   manufactured by arc melting. The microstructure of the materials was
   analyzed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray
   diffraction. The Vickers microhardness of these alloys were also
   measured. Detailed characterization revealed the formation of a
   dual-phase matrix (fcc + hcp) due to the reduction in the stability of
   the fcc phase that led to a thermal induced partial martensitic
   transformation into a epsilon-hcp phase. The addition of boron promoted
   the formation of M2B-type borides (M = Cr, Fe), whose content increased
   with the addition of B. Changes in the phase composition, specifically
   the decrease of the hcp phase, were mainly due to the loss of manganese
   content. The microstrain analysis showed the absence of residual
   stresses in the crystal lattice due to a decrease in the dislocation's
   density after the martensitic transformation. When boron content was
   brought from 0 wt\% to 1.7 wt\%, the microhardness of the material
   increased from 296HV to 452 HV, which is comparable to the microhardness
   of high-manganese steel. Finally, the thermodynamic parameter Phi was
   calculated using a phase prediction package AlloyASAP, allowing to
   establish that boron addition to Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10 originated
   medium-entropy alloys (Phi < 1), while the absence of boron give a
   high-entropy alloy (Phi > 1).}},

   at 773 K for 42 d, colonies of (Ni,Fe)(2)MnAl- enriched Heusler phase

Abstract = {{A novel graded material of a high-entropy alloy (HEA) FeCoCrNiMo was
   fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) processing. After SPS, the
   HEA specimens consisted of a single face-centred cubic (FCC) phase in
   the center, but dual FCC and a tetragonal structure sigma phase near the
   surface. Surprisingly, the sintering pressure was sufficient to
   influence the proportion of phases, and thus the properties of HEA
   samples. The hardness of the specimens sintered under the pressures of
   30, 35, and 40 MPa increased gradually from 210 HV0.2, which is the
   single FCC phase in the center, to the maximum value near the surface as
   a result of the gradual increase in the fraction of the transformed
   sigma phase. The sigma phase, being a complex hard and brittle
   intermetallic particle to manipulate the properties of FCC-type HEA
   systems, which could be influenced by pressure, indicated a major
   possibility for designing gradient HEA materials.}},

Abstract = {{V element had positive effect in improving the strength of many alloys,

Abstract = {{High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are multiprincipal element alloys with

   Different heat treatments were applied, and the microstructure and

   of up to 3.0 wt.\% Ti significantly increases the hardness of the alloy
   from 300 to 500 (Hv) by the combined effect of solid solution
   strengthening and via decreasing lamellar spacing. Heat treatment at 900
   degrees C for 10h enhanced the hardness at lower Ti percentages (0.0-0.8
   wt.\%) by decreasing the lamellar spacing, while no change was observed
   at higher Ti content. It was also observed that extending the treatment
   time to 20h affected negatively the hardness of the alloy. Concluding,
   HEAs can achieve high hardness using low-cost principle elements with
   minor alloying additives compared to the other traditional alloys.}},
